# P2SubmissionBackend
The Online Auction System Backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for user authentication, auction management, and bidding. Users can sign up, log in, create, edit, delete auctions, and place bids. It ensures secure passwords and auto-closes expired auctions. Run with node server.js. Future update: real-time bidding with WebSockets.
